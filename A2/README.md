# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by YOURNAME

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Half a month. Complete a part every day. (GUI takes a lot of time) 
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Successfully finished AS2. And learned a lot of knowledge about python.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I didn't learn GUI and kivy so well that I couldn't complete it very quickly.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The basic grammar will not go wrong. The writing speed of the code is accelerated. At the same time, it also deepens the understanding and memory of no knowledge.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Be more attentive to knowledge that you don't understand.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Search for relevant code knowledge on Google. At the same time, I also bought relevant books for self-learning

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
There are too many knowledge loopholes in the GUI program. A lot of time is spent on studying and reviewing after class. At the same time, the teacher has a thorough understanding of the content learned in the class.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
In the past, errors occurred in some basic grammatical statements and the program could not proceed normally. Later, the code can run normally. At the same time, the code does not look as messy as before.
